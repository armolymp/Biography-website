        <article id="java"><img src="java.jpg" alt="java logo" width="100%" height="300px"> Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have
             as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let 
             programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
             support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that 
             can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. .

        <article id="python"><img src="python.jpeg" alt="python logo" width="100%" height="300px"> Python was conceived in the late 1980s[39] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands
             as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[40] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba
              operating system.[11] Its implementation began in December 1989.[41] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the
               lead developer, until 12 July 2018.

         <article id="dart"><img src="dart.png" alt="dart logo" width="100%" height="300px"> Dart is a client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to offer the most
              productive programming language for multi-platform development, paired with a flexible execution runtime platform for app frameworks.
              Languages are defined by their technical envelope â€” the choices made during development that shape the capabilities and 
              strengths of a language. Dart is designed for a technical envelope that is particularly suited to client development.
